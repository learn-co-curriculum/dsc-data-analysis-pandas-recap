    "In this section, we spent time getting comfortable with pandas and getting some more practice with exploratory data analysis. Some of the key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For non-trivial datasets you'll usually want to store your data in pandas data structures rather than native Python lists and dictionaries \n",
    "* Pandas has a range of great features for easily importing data from anything from a CSV, an Excel file, JSON, SQL, or a Python dictionary  \n",
    "* Pandas `Series` and `DataFrame` classes have a bunch of powerful methods for munging data \n",
    "* Pandas also has a range of methods for applying descriptive statistics to Series and DataFrames \n",
    "* Finally, by wrapping Matplotlib, Pandas also provides some very convenient plotting capabilities for quickly visualizing data \n",
    "* We also got some experience working with the Ames Housing dataset, and set up accounts on Kaggle - a really useful resource for practicing data scientists."
